A **code cell** contains code in Python, a programming language that we will be using for the remainder of this module. You can select any cell by clicking it once. After a cell is selected, you can navigate the notebook using the up and down arrow keys.\n",

For example, we cannot add two variables `x + y` until there has been code earlier that declares x = 2 and y = 3 (though both can take on any values). This error will return a `name 'x' is not defined` error. To fix this, make sure x (or the appropriate variable) is declared. \n",

However, broadly this table has each column as a year (which might be very similar to the life expectancy we just saw), and a value for each year. If we look at the data at hand, we might be able to see some trends if we look year to year. There are more useful methods of looking at this data though, through things like graphs and other visualizations. "
