    "Decision trees are a powerful prediction method and are easy to interpret. A decision tree can explain exactly why a specific prediction was made. They usually aren't used by themselves, but many trees are used for ensemble methods such as random forests and bagging. Trees are, overall, a relatively more accessible method for predictive modeling since they are used for both regression and classification and can take in both continuous and categorical data.\n",

    "In this homework, we'll be doing a brief exploration of the CalEnviroScreen dataset, testing out how to make a tree from scratch, as well as implementing various ensemble methods using scikit-learn. It'll be a comprehensive survey of trees and the multitude of algorithms that arise from one tree!\n",

The various variables in this dataset contribute to the CES score, which reflects a community's environmental conditions and its vulnerability to environmental pollutants.\n",
