    "1. The rules are *simple*.  You can learn most of them in a few weeks and gain reasonable proficiency with the language in a semester.\n",

    "Whenever you write code, you will often accientally break some of these rules. When you run a code cell that doesn't follow every rule exactly, Python will produce an **error message**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Errors are *normal*; experienced programmers make many errors every day. Errors are also *not dangerous*; you will not break your computer by making an error (in fact, errors are a big part of how you learn a coding language). An error is nothing more than a message from the computer saying it doesn't understand you and asking you to rewrite your command.\n",
