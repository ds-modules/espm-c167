    "The *Home Owners' Loan Corporation*, otherwise known as **HOLC**, began in the 1930s as a government-financed by-product of Roosevelt's New Deal. Its original goals were to refinance property mortgages to prevent foreclosures while expanding buying opportunities for those looking for new homes. \n",
    "\n",
    "HOLC primarily operated by issuing loans to borrowers. Loans, otherwise known as IOU's, are contracts in which an individual is able to immediately borrow a determined amount of money while claiming the responsibility of paying off that amount plus interests and fees. In the context of HOLC, loans were distributed to homeowners who struggled to make consistent housing payments. In addition to distributing loans, HOLC also assessed credit-worthiness for different groups of people within a specific city. This so-called credit-worthiness created borders, which targeted minorities (African Americans specifically) and separated neighborhoods on the basis of a perceived financial risk. This process of separation became known as ***redlining*** and can be found throughout several *HOLC maps*, including the one from the NYT article as well as the one seen below for **Minneapolis**. "
