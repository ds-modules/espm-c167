In addition to distributing loans, HOLC also assessed \"creditworthiness\" for different groups of people within a specific city. In assessing \"creditworthiness\", HOLC created borders that separated neighborhoods  and targeted minorities (particularly African Americans) on the basis of perceived financial risk. This process of separation became known as ***redlining***, which you can see on *HOLC maps* including the one from the New York Times article above.
